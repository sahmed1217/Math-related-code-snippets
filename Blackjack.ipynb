I started by asking them what values do they think they should \"hit\" at, and each class there was at least one student who pointed out that they would also want to know how likely it is that their opponent's hand would beat theirs. So we checked this empirically by drawing several two-card hands. I threw this together to compute the distribution so I could do a goodness of fit test against their observations."],"metadata":{"id":"ihnKFFIK3nyE"},"id":"ihnKFFIK3nyE"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"5dc45a28","metadata":{"id":"5dc45a28","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708220207330,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":427,"user":{"displayName":"Shehzad Ahmed","userId":"10882598097768868404"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import math\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["First, we create a dictionary that assigns each card a point value.
